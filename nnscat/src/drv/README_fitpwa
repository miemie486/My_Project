Phase shifts by the Chengdu potential

* Check drv_fitpwa for detailed usage of specific subroutines, such as how many
parameters are needed at certain order

* The path is where input parameters can be found for the corresponding subroutine

* Only 1S0, 3S1-3D1, and 3P0 contribute to LO

  Name of subroutines               Path of parameter files
1S0:
  Getspr1s0_smpl_fitpwa             saved/spr1s0/fitspr_Q2_800.arx
3S1-3D1:
  GetNPCpld_fitpwa                  saved/3s1/fit3s1_Q2_rslt.arx
3P0:
  GetNPWithC0Sngl_fitpwa            saved/3p0/fit3p0_Q2_rslt.arx

* Other channels vanish at LO, but start to contribute at NLO, including

  uncoupled channels:
    GetPOPESngl_fitpwa              saved/shaowei/suppope/set2/

  coupled channels:
