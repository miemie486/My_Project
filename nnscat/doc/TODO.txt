- Rewrite check_f90makefile.py

- Is flag self%TQn_updated still useful?

- All class variables should be intent(inout) instead of intent(in)

- (Done!) Check the mechanism of checking unitarity is in functioning.

- A better way to manage physical constants.

- Add code to compute deuteron wave function.

- (Done!) Check all code styled as “self%obj_parent%method”. Decide whether to change
  them to “call method_parent(self)”.

- (Done!) Change the loop-index order so that the inner-most loop-index operates on
  the left-most array index. E.g.

  do jj = 1, N2
      do ii = 1, N1
          “works on A(ii, jj)”
      end do
  end do

- (Done!) Merge load_Cs method with load_inputs

- (Done!) Change get_num_cnttrm_* to get_num_paras_*
  (Done!) Change get_cnttrm_filename_* to get_paras_filename_*

- (Done!) Change "kmatrix" to "kcotd"
