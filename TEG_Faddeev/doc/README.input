If you want to use file to input data, please obey this format:

1. Every line of useful data must have a title for program to recogniz.
    For example:
        maxOpT,0.5
2. Only one type of data per row.
3. Use ',' to split.
    For example:
        NP,3,8,12
4. The order of each row of data is not important
5. If you want to write something to explain those data, please begin with #.
    (In fact, it ’s okay if you don’t follow the fifth item, but your input file will become more cluttered.)
    (This behavior may bring some problem to you, while caculating.)
6. I have set a series of default parameters, if there are something wrong in your input file,
    program will use default parameters to caculate. If you see default at the end of some parameters, 
    this parameter isn't import successfully.
    (There may be situations I have not considered, causing the program to fail to report the wrong location accurately.)
7. Only the following beginnings are currently recognized:
    
    maxL
    maxOpT
    opJ
    parity
    label
    mambda
    NP
    potential
    NX
    CMRatio
    RFMTHD
